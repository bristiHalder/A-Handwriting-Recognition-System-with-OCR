# **OCR**
This project aims to create an OCR system that can accurately read and convert handwritten text into digital format.

## **Features**
- Image pre-processing for better OCR results.
- Using Tesseract OCR for text extraction.
- Simple and efficient techniques to improve OCR accuracy.
  
## **Architecture**
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to extract and process features from the input images.
- Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) Layer for Decoding.
